Twilio Video - iOS Sample - Advanced Capturing and Rendering
==============================================================

> NOTE: This sample application uses Twilio's deprecated Programmable Video Conversations API. We plan on updating this app for Swift 3.x and the Rooms API, at which point we will be merging it into the [video-ios-quickstart-swift](https://github.com/twilio/video-quickstart-swift) repo.

This project is a sample application using [Twilio Video for iOS](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/video). It aims to demonstrate more advanced video capturing and rendering techniques than the [Quickstart application](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/video/guide/quickstart-ios).

### Requirements
This application was most recently updated to run against [version 0.25.0](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/video/changelogs/ios) of the Twilio Video iOS SDK. 

### How to Run

* **Step 1:** Clone the repository to your local machine

* **Step 2 (option 1 - CocoaPods):** Run `pod install` at your terminal, from inside the cloned repository's working directory. Then open the Xcode Workspace created by CocoaPods (`VideoSampleCaptureRender.xcworkspace`).

* **Step 2 (option 2 - manual):** Open the Xcode project (`VideoSampleCaptureRender.xcodeproj`) from the cloned repository's working directory. [Download](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/video/sdks#ios-sdk) the iOS Conversations framework and iOS Twilio Common framework. Drag and drop the framework files into your Xcode project, making sure that "Copy items if needed" is checked.

* **Step 3:** Insert a valid Twilio Access Token to `ViewController.swift` in place of the placeholder string `TWILIO_ACCESS_TOKEN`. You can generate a demo access token [here](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/video/dev-tools/testing-tools). Once you have this working, you may wish to connect your app with a server that [generates Access Tokens on-demand](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/video/guide/identity).

* **Step 4:** Run the app. Running on a physical device will deliver a better experience, as the simulator cannot provide camera access.
